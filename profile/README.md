## How It Works

ClubHub aggregates event data by fetching posts from Instagram using a Python-based pipeline powered by GitHub Actions, Instaloader, and Hugging Face. This data is then stored in a Supabase database, making it easy to manage and display. Our front end, built with React and Tailwind CSS, provides a clean and interactive interface for users to explore and engage with club events.
